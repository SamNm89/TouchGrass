I built this project for a friend who need this in his life


#Goal or things to deal with later

-~~-the functioin that import an icon from the game/s url .exe .ink you picked after you choosed them from "add games" contenct menu works terribly.~~


-~~the games in the library of the program not in grid with square shape ( i mean the icons of the games)~~



-~~there no settings button on the programm to change the hotkey that open the progra~~
-~~add in the tray context menu the same acces to edit hotkey button~~
