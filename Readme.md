I built this project for a friend who need this in his life


#Goal or things to deal with later

-the functioin that import an icon from the game/s url .exe .ink you picked after you choosed them from "add games" contenct menu works terribly.


~~the games in the library of the program not in grid with square shape ( i mean the icons of the games)~~



~~there no settings button on the programm to change the hotkey that open the progra~~
~~add in the tray context menu the same acces to edit hotkey button~~


~~add in settings option to turn on/off the option to make the program run on startup~~

~~stop the auto hide feature for the program window .  the program appear after pressing the hotkey and it only hide when u click minimize button or close button~~ 


~~implement Single-Instance checking~~

- improve the UI

- fix the icon preview in the icon import menu is postioning the icon wrong

~~add in settings the ability to show/hide tray icon~~

- add more visuals to the UI

- add the ability to give games tags and filter by tags
- add the ability to see games as gird (current format) or list (picture from left, name from right)
- add the ability to show the games size (another info to be visible in the list view)
